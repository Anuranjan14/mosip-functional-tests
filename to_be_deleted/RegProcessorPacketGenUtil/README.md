## Packet Generation Utility
This folder contains the codes of utility to generate packets from an available sample packet.  
It can be executed from inside an IDE or from terminal by converting it to a jar.  
All the resources by the utility are kept in src/main/resources, which get to run time resources directory via the class loader.<br/>
<br/>
config.properties file contains the properties needed at run time. Properties such as base url of an environment, number of threads, system path to generate packets are mentioned in this property file.<br/>
This file also contains the properties mentioning path of the pre-existing packets inside the project. These pre-existing packets are referred by the utility to generate new packets of similar file structures. <br/><br/>
The utility refers to masterdata table to access values of various locations ( hierarchy based) to be used in the identity json of the packet. Database connection properties have to mentioned in regProc__.cfg.xml file corresponding to the environement. If file name doesn't matches to current environemnet, hibernate.cfg.xml file is treated as the default configuration file for database access.<br/><br/>

The utility works in various modes which are discussed below. The application accepts a command-line argument based on which mode the utility executes, is decided:<br/>
The entry point class Main is defined inside the package *io.mosip.registrationProcessor.perf.client*
1. packet_gen - Utility runs in multi threaded way to generate packets in bulk, for multiple new packets or a child packet with parent RID. Only adult packets or child packets can be generated in an execution. The values of NUMBER_OF_THREADS_PACKET_CREATION mutipied by NUMBER_OF_TEST_PACKETS mentioned in config.properties file will decide the number of total generated packets. The property IS_CHILD_PACKET in config.properties file must be set to a proper value to generate either adult or a child packet.
2. new_packet - Utility runs to genrate a single new packet; an adult or a child based on the value assigned for IS_CHILD_PACKET property in config.properties file.
3. sync_data - Utility runs to sync the generated packets. Registration processor's sync API is invoked as part of this to sync the generated packets one by one.
4. update_packet - Utility runs to generate an update packet. Registration ID of a successfully processed packet must be provided in config.properties file for REGID_TO_UPDATE property.
5. decrypt_packet- Utility runs to decrypt an encrypted packet, the packet must be provided as a pre-defined path mentioned in config.properties file and also the process of the encrypted packet must be mentioned in config.properties file.
6. sync_data_multiple - Utility runs to sync the generated packets. In this mode, packets of multiple processes type can be synced.
7. packet_upload - Utility runs to upload the generated and synced packet by reading the path of packets from a file generated earlier. packets with regid and path mentioned in the file are uploaded one by one
<br/><br/>
The utility can be built to an executable jar by using Maven goals. If wish to excute the utility as a jar, the required resources present in src/main/resources when executed from IDE, should be placed inside MosipTestResource present in the same parent directory where the jar is.
